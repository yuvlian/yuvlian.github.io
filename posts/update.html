<h1 id="hi">Hi!</h1>
<p>So about &quot;That&#39;s all for today, no guarantee I&#39;ll be making another post but I quite enjoy this so I probably will.&quot; in my previous post, yeah I lied so bad lol.</p>
<p>It was mostly because I&#39;m lazy, but now...</p>
<p>I really have nothing interesting in my life anymore.</p>
<p>I know nobody&#39;s gonna read this but damn, I really am lonely. So lonely. Way too lonely.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve done so many different things to distract myself, but nothing works. Everything is so boring. Not inherently, but rather because I wish he was here too.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t thing I&#39;ll ever move on either. I mean, I already have two people still on my mind since 2 years ago, now it&#39;s another tally.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know how am I supposed to enjoy life anymore.</p>
<p>Oh well, I just hope I die in my sleep, if I don&#39;t then I&#39;ll just try my best to graduate college, after that I&#39;m going to run away and live in a remote forest. I don&#39;t care about progressing in life anymore. Sorry dad and mom that your son is a chronic loner loser with no talent.</p>
