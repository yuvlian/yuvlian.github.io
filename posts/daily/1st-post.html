<h1 id="so-today">So today...</h1>
<p>Nothing really interesting, it&#39;s saturday, after all. But as happy as I am currently, I sometimes miss the busyness of workdays during saturday and sunday. And then the vice versa happens when it&#39;s actually a workday, haha. Can&#39;t be helped, humans are never satisfied with what they have.</p>
<p>Since there&#39;s not much to say, I&#39;ll share some things that I have done and saw today. Me and my friends played L4D2 in the morning then at noon I tried to revive , which didn&#39;t go to well because a certain shark vtuber fan stripped the protobufs. Then there&#39;s nothing interesting until... </p>
<h2 id="drama-alert">DRAMA ALERT!!</h2>
<p>Oh what&#39;s this, a screenshot from Doonle? A certain someone is getting angry at him? Angry because of their own fault? Playing victim too?! No way I am getting left out!</p>
<p>Then I, naturally, showed it to another friend, who was also a victim of this someone... We all laughed together! How can someone like this exist?! To betray people&#39;s trust so easily, to steal their works, and ultimately, getting angry at them too?! What the sigma?!</p>
<p>Well, enough drama. Another thing I did today is cleaning up my SSD! I went from having 90GB left to 230GB left, how cool is that? Though, I had to sacrifice many programming languages, my ISOs, softwares, and my project files... Oh and most importantly, deleted Genshin Impact. I forgot I still had that sad excuse of a video game installed.</p>
<p>I kept Rust and Deno, though. Not a surprise, since I use Rust alot. But Deno, I&#39;ve never used it despite installing it some months ago. So I decided to try it out, and looked for something made with it and voila, here it is. <a href="https://github.com/jaredkrinke/md2blog">md2blog</a>, made by Jared Krinke, was used to make this page. Very cool, huh? </p>
<p>That&#39;s all for today, no guarantee I&#39;ll be making another post but I quite enjoy this so I probably will.</p>
